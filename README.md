# Pipad
In this project, I am building a replacement logic board around a Raspberry Pi CM4.

I have a [project on Hackaday.io](https://hackaday.io/project/177256-put-a-raspberry-pi-cm4-into-an-original-ipad) and this is the corresponding Github repository.

*NOTE: Newest development takes place in cm4 branch* 

## The Mission

The 2010 iPad is completely unsupported, and is almost useless. It will still run old apps, but almost all internet-connected apps are broken. Even browsing the web in Safari is difficult, since iOS 5 has out-of-date TLS CAs.

But still, it's a pretty good piece of hardware in many ways. If we were to replace the logic board, we could still use these parts:

* Case
* 25 watt-hour battery
* capacitive touchscreen digitizer
* 1024x768 LCD
* 2x wifi/bluetooth antennas
* mono speaker
* TRRS port
* microphone
* ambient light sensor
* four buttons (lock/unlock, volume up, volume down), one switch (rotation)
* The wifi/BT module
* 30-pin connector
